Gunicorn configuration for running the Flask app.

This configuration uses a modest number of workers and threads to handle
concurrent requests without overwhelming free hosting resources.  It also
increases the default timeout to allow the Telegram bot to start before
Gunicorn considers the worker unresponsive.
